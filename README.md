# DefWeb: Defending User Privacy against Cache-based Website Fingerprinting Attacks with Intelligent Noise Injection
We develop a generative learning-based defense technique, DefWeb, to protect user privacy against cache-based Website Fingerprinting(WF) attacks by injecting precise noise into the WFs. For this purpose, (1) we train a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to represent high-dimensional fingerprints in a low-dimension space while creating distinct clusters for each website. (2) Minimal noise templates are extracted in the low-dimension space to obfuscate the fingerprints efficiently. (3) We create practical noise templates that can be added to WFs during website rendering by leveraging self-modifying code (SMC). We implement DefWeb in simulation and real-world setups to degrade the attackerâ€™s model accuracy. DefWeb can decrease the model accuracy to 1.1% and 28.8% in simulation and real-world setups, respectively.

# Data Collection:
## Cache-based WF attack 
<!---- (Robust Website Fingerprinting Through the Cache Occupancy Channel)
   For collecting Website Fingerprints for different websites, follow the steps mentioned below:<br/>
  * For the offline phase, the attacker can change the cache size in his device to match the victim's device and collect data, which will be employed to train the ML model. 
  -->
- (Demo) With two Website Fingerprint (WF) datasets, which are www.google.com and www.amazon.com.
- In our project, we collected 100 measurements for each of 100 different websites [Website list](https://github.com/hunie-son/DefWeb/blob/main/Data_Collection/website_list.txt), overall 10,000 measurements.
  
- Data collection for Google Chrome Browser:
  * (Demo) `PrimeProbe_google.html` and `PrimeProbe_amazon.html` are JavaScript codes of Prime and Probe attack created by Dr. Yossi Oren's research team. (You can create 100 different Prime and Probe attack JavaScript codes based on the [Website list](https://github.com/hunie-son/DefWeb/blob/main/Data_Collection/website_list.txt))
    
  * (Demo) Collecting WF dataset 2 websites (www.amazon.com and www.google.com) automatically using bash script  <br/>
  `cd DefWeb/Data_Collection`<br/>
  `./run_demo_chrome.sh`<br/>
  
  * Collecting WF dataset 100 websites automatically using bash script (Chrome) <br/>
  `cd DefWeb/Data_Collection/Chrome`<br/>
  `./run_chrome.sh`<br/>
  
   * Collected 100 websites WF datasets are provided `DefWeb/Data_Collection/Chrome/Chrome_Collected_100`

- Data collection for Mozilla Firefox Browser:
  * (Demo) Collecting WF dataset 2 websites (www.amazon.com and www.google.com) automatically using bash script  <br/>
  `cd DefWeb/Data_Collection`<br/>
  `./run_demo_firefox.sh`<br/>
  
  * The procedure is the same as Chrome Browser [Website list](https://github.com/hunie-son/DefWeb/blob/main/Data_Collection/website_list.txt). <br/>
  
   * Collecting WF dataset 100 websites automatically using bash script (Firefox) <br/>
  `cd DefWeb/Data_Collection/Firefox`<br/>
  `./run_firefox.sh`<br/>
   * Collected 100 websites WF datasets are provided `DefWeb/Data_Collection/Firefox/Firefox_Collected_100`

- Preprocessing:
  * Merged CSV file (10,000 x 6,000) is large to upload in the GitHub repository.
    
  * We provide preprocessing python code ([Preprocessing_WF.ipynb](https://github.com/hunie-son/DefWeb/blob/main/Data_Collection/Preprocessing_WF.ipynb)) to create WF Dataset (single csv file) with the order.
    
  * (Demo) `trainX_2_US_Chrome.csv` and `trainY_2_US_Chrome.csv` are preprocessed WF dataset for wwww.amazon.com and www.google.com. 

After preprocessing the data, the final training data (trainX and trainY) will created.


# WF Attack:
- We use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM) to conduct WF attacks.
   * We provide CNN python code ([CNN_Final.ipynb](https://github.com/hunie-son/DefWeb/blob/main/Attack_Model/CNN_Final.ipynb)) with explanation.
     
   * We provide LSTM python code ([LSTM_Final.ipynb](https://github.com/hunie-son/DefWeb/blob/main/Attack_Model/LSTM_Final.ipynb)) with explanation.
     
   * (Demo) Input data: Preprocessed data (`trainX_2_US_Chrome.csv` and `trainY_2_US_Chrome.csv`)
     
   * Output: Accuracy
