Files and Explanations:

- noise_template.csv: An example noise template generated by VAE. This is an analytical noise template that we need to mimic.
- repeat_delay_template.csv: This file consists of repeat and delay values that will create a specific SMC practical noise.
- smc_example.csv: An example SMC practical noise collected with the practical noise generation tool.
- prime_probe_smc_analysis.html: Prime and Probe attack code to be run in a browser. This file is originally created by Dr. Yossi Oren's team.
- smc_analysis_for_paper_GC.sh: This code runs the practical noise code. You are expected to run this code.
- SMC_generation_visualization_artifact_code.m: The Matlab code to visualize both analytical and practical noise templates.
- smc.asm: This code is used to create practical noise with given repeat and delay values.
- main.c: This is the main code that run the assembly file to create smc noise.
